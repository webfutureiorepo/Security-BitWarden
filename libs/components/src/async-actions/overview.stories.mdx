# Async Actions

The directives in this module makes it easier for developers to reflect the progress of async actions in the UI when using
buttons, while also providing robust and standardized error handling.

These buttons can either be standalone (such as Refresh buttons), submit buttons for forms or as standalone buttons
that are part of a form (such as Delete buttons).

These directives are meant to replace the older `appApiAction` directive, providing the option to use `observables` and reduce
clutter inside our view `components`.

## When to use?

When building a button that triggers a long running task in the background eg. server API calls.

## Why?

To better visualize that the application is processing their request.

## What does it do?

It disables buttons and show a spinning animation.
